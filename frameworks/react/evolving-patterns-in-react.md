# Evolving Patterns in React

### Speaker: [Alex Moldovan](https://github.com/alexnm)
### Date: 29.05.2018
### Venue: Fortech
### Description:
I'm preparing this Intermediate-Advanced React workshop and I thought I could give it a run inside the community.

This is the approximate curricula I will try to focus on, but I have no idea how much can be covered in approx 2 hours:

Advanced Component Design
- Conditional Rendering
- Using ESnext Class Properties
- Curried Event Handlers
- Stateless vs Pure Components
Having Fun with Props
- Children Props
- Pass-through Props
- Destructuring Props
Reusing and Composing in React
- Mixins
- High-Order Components
- Render Props
Provider Pattern
- The new Context API
State Management
- State Lifting
- When is Redux needed

* Please keep in mind that I will not go through the basics or React and I assume you know how to work with props/state, lifecycle hooks, etc.
** Bring your laptops, this will be a hands-on workshop
