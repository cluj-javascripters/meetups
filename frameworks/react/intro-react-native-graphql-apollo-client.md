# Intro to React-Native and Apollo-Client

### Speaker: [Emilia Muresan](https://twitter.com/emi_codes)
### Date: 05.02.2019
### Venue: TechNTrade
### Description:

Using [Github's GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) as a backend, we'll be working on a small client app in ‚öõÔ∏è react-native + üöÄ apollo-client. This app will serve as a playground, and help us cover these topics:
* getting started with react-native: using expo vs. building projects with native code
* handling routing via react-navigation
* setting up apollo-client and executing some basic operations (queries, mutations)
* offline support
* styling using styled-components

This will be a presentation + live coding.
