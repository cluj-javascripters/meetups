# Full Stack React in the Era of Serverless Computing

### Speakers: [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3)
### Date: 04.03.2019
### Venue: TechNTrade
### Description:

When people speak about serverless, they typically tend to think about a collection of functions calling each other when in reality the best serverless applications consist of thick client code handling all interaction logic, heavy use of managed services & small glue functions to fill in the missing pieces.

In this talk, I'll introduce a workflow that allows React developers to build full stack applications using JavaScript & web technologies by taking advantage of managed services & databases, implementing real-world features like authentication, GraphQL APIs, serverless Lambda functions, & chatbots using a CLI based workflow.
