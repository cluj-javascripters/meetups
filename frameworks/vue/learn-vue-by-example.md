### Meeting notes:

#### Free Vue Admin Dashboard
With the ocassion of this workshop, me and [Creative-Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) would like to offer 45 free licences to one of our Vue dashboards. The dashboard is based on Vue and usually ranges between $49-$59 but it will be free for the people who attended the workshop. 

Go to [this link](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/vue-now-ui-dashboard-pro?voucher=vuejs-meetup) and click on the "Voucher" button then insert "vuejs-meetup" in the text field.
You should be able to download an archive with the dashboard template. There is a comprehensive [online documentation](https://timcreative.github.io/vue-now-ui-dashboard-pro/documentation/#/getting-started)
