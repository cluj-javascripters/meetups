# End-to-End testing with TestCafe

### Speaker: [Daniel Mocan](https://twitter.com/danielsmocan) & [Ciprian Druhora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciprian-druhora-969193b1/)
### Date: 19.09.2018
### Venue: 3Pillar
### Description:
I believe most of the programers are lazy (I’m one of them :) ) and dislike complicated setups. Luckily for end-to-end testing, we have an easy to use and a very very simple setup tool called TestCafe, powered with JavaScript.
To get the most out of this workshop, we will keep the presentations to a minimum to have more time for hands-on examples.

What will we do?
1. We'll have a short general presentation about TestCafe
2. We'll create end-to-end tests for a registration page.

* You will need a laptop
** This meetup is beginners friendly. Our goal is to show how easy is to setup and use TestCafe.
