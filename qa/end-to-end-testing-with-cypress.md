# End-to-End testing with Cypress

### Speaker: [Robert Pop](https://twitter.com/robipop22)
### Date: 19.09.2018
### Venue: Telenav
### Description: 
I believe that web has evolved with all these new frameworks and platforms and I think we can improve the end-to-end experience with our new web products and also to close the gap between the testers and developers. This workshop will focus on getting things started with Cypress and show some benefits of using it.
What will we do?
1. A general presentation about web testing and Cypress and how I personally heard about it
2. Weâ€™ll create from scratch some automation tests written in JS

* You will need a laptop
** this meetup is for beginners and we will try to show how easy one can setup Cypress and begin writing tests
