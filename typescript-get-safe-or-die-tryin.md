# TypeScript - Get Safe or Die Tryin'

### Speaker: [Ovidiu Cherecheș](https://twitter.com/skidding)
### Date: 15.10.2019
### Venue: Wolfpack Digital
### Description:
Is TypeScript worth the trouble? For some people, it’s a lifesaver, while for others it’s a headache.
For me, it’s the former. I use it all the time and the benefit far outweighs the cost.

In this talk, I share my (positive) experience with TypeScript and speculate on why your experience might be different.
