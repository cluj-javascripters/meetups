# Ask Me Anything (about JS)
### Speakers: All
### Date: 16.07.2019
### Venue: Evozon
### Description:
Hello JavaScripters,

We are proposing a new type of meetup, the idea came from our previous gatherings where sometimes the discussion would go sideways, in a good way of course, but the deviations opened up a lot of discussion threads. So it only made sense to organize a meetup where we can do just that!

In this meetup, we are all open to add any questions related to:
* JavaScript
* Web,
* where to start learning from
* etcâ€¦

Anyone is welcomed to join, especially developers that are at the beginning of the road.
Ask Me Anything meetup is a place where we can all share and ask questions.

### Questions
1. What valuable resources do you recomned?

2. How do you start with open-source?

3. What is the required interview level for a JS position?

4. How can I find mentors to learn more?

5. How should I start learning JS? (Front-end, Backend)

6. Front-end vs JS Developer positions? ( CSS + HTML level )

7. Working with JS, will it get better?

8. Work-learning life balance? When do you get to learn?

9. Which framework to start with is the best?

10.
