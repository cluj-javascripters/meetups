# Lightning Talks 2019

### Date: 20.11.2019
### Venue: Techntrade
### Description:
We are happy to invite you to our last tech meetup of the year. For this event we are trying something new, a LIGHTNING TALKS session. How does it work? Instead of having one presentation, we will have more, but shorter, which will be on different subjects.

Some of the topics we will cover will be:
- Transformation matrix explained - Andrei Cacio
- Handling Mobile Application Updates - Eliza Nitoi
- A quick guide to effective code reviews - Emilia Muresan
- Server Side Rendering - Why you should know about it - Robert Pop
- Brave browser & Basic Attention Token - Mihai Plesa
